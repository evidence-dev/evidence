# How It Works

Evidence is an open-source, code-based alternative to drag-and-drop business intelligence tools.

![how-it-works](sites/docs/static/img/how-it-works.png)

Evidence generates a website from markdown files:

- **SQL statements** inside markdown files run queries against your data sources
- **Charts and components** are rendered using these query results
- **Templated pages** generate many pages from a single markdown template
- **Loops** and **If / Else** statements allow control of what is displayed to users

# Install

1. Download the [Evidence VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Evidence.evidence-vscode)
2. Open the Command Palette (F1) and enter `Evidence: New Evidence Project`
3. Click the Start Evidence button in the bottom status bar

See docs for [other install options](https://docs.evidence.dev/getting-started/install-evidence) (CLI, Docker, etc)
