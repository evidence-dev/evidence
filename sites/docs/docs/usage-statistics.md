title: Usage Statistics
---

We collect basic usage information in order to understand how many people are actively using the project:
* Anonymous ID
* Query Timestamp
* Query Type (query, cache, or error)
* Mode (dev mode or production mode)

This information is crucial for the project's development, but you can turn it off by adding the below to your `evidence.config` file:

```json
"send_anonymous_usage_stats": false 
```
