---


This is a guided tutorial to help you build your first Evidence app. If you'd prefer to learn how Evidence works, start with the [Syntax](/core-concepts/syntax/).

<Alert>

   **By the end of this 10 minute guide, you will be able to:**

  - Create and edit a page in Evidence
  - Write a query on demo data
  - Create a table
  - Create a chart
  - Connect a new CSV data source

</Alert>

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have already installed Evidence: [Install Evidence](/install-evidence).

If you are new to web development, start with the [Basics](#basics).

If you are familiar with running a server at `localhost`, and writing pages in Markdown, skip to [Working with data](#working-with-data).

## Basics
### 1. Start Evidence

Evidence can be started from VSCode, or from the Command Line. Both will work for this tutorial. If you're unsure, start with VSCode:

<Tabs>
   <Tab label="VSCode">

      Click `Start Evidence` in the bottom status bar:

      <img src="/img/getting-started/start_evidence.png" class="w-96 border border-gray-200 rounded"/>
   </Tab>
   <Tab label="Command Line">

      From the root of your project directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

   </Tab>
</Tabs>

<br>

If you chose a different setup during [Install Evidence](/install-evidence/#other-options), use the command that matches your setup.

Your browser should open automatically. If it doesn't, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` in the address bar. You should see your Evidence app:

![Evidence landing page](/img/getting-started/evidence_landing.png)

You have now started Evidence in a **local development server** on your own machine.


### 2. Add a new page

Go back to VSCode (or your file editor of choice) and open the `src/pages` directory. Right-click on the `pages` directory and select `New File`. Name the file `new-page.md`, or a name of your choice.

Add the following to the file and save it (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`):

```markdown
## Hello Evidence

This is a new page in Evidence.
```

Refresh Evidence in your browser. You should see your new page in the sidebar:

![New page in Evidence](/img/getting-started/new_page.png)

### 3. Write Markdown
Make some more changes to the page. You'll see them reflected "live" in the browser, immediately after saving. There is no need to restart the server.

This is called **hot reloading** (HMR), and it allows you to see your changes in real-time as you are building your page.

Evidence pages are `.md` files, and are written in a popular language called Markdown. You can learn more about Markdown [here](https://docs.evidence.dev/reference/markdown/).

You can also insert HTML directly into your page if you need more control.

Here are some examples of Markdown and HTML to try:

```markdown
## Hello Evidence

This is a new page in Evidence.

### This is a lower level header
This is some *italic* and **bold** text.

This is a [link](https://evidence.dev).

This is an image inserted using Markdown:
![alt text](https://evidence.dev/brand-assets/wordmark-black.png)

This is an image inserted using HTML:
<img src="https://evidence.dev/brand-assets/wordmark-black.png" alt="evidence logo" class="w-72"/>

```

Here's how it will look when rendered in the browser:

![Markdown rendered in Evidence.](/img/getting-started/markdown_html.png)

Now that you know how to create and edit pages, let's move on to working with data.

## Working with data
### 4. Understand data sources and queries

Navigate to `localhost:3000/settings` in your browser.

Here you'll find our demo dataset, `needful_things`. It is a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database, which is one of many databases that Evidence supports.

![The Evidence settings page.](/img/getting-started/duck_db.png)

Later in this tutorial you will learn how to add a new data source. For now, we will use `needful_things` to write a **source query**.

A data source in Evidence always consists of at least 2 types of files, but may have more.

1. A **connection.yaml** file. Any non-secret configuration needed to connect to your data source will be saved here. This file is automatically generated when you create a new data source via the `/settings` page.
2. **Source queries** allow you to filter and transform your data source before using it on a page. You may not need all of the tables from `needful_things`, or you may only need a few columns from a certain table. Your source query should be written in the dialect of SQL that matches your data source. A single data source can have multiple source queries.
3. (Sometimes) A **connection.options.yaml** file. Any secret credentials needed to connect to your data source will be saved here (base64 encoded). This file is automatically generated when you create a new data source via the `/settings` page.
4. (Sometimes) A **data file** itself. In our example, all of our data sits within a file called `needful_things.duckdb`.

You will see this reflected in the folder structure for each data source under the `sources` folder:

```code
sources/
`-- needful_things/
   |-- connection.yaml
   |-- needful_things.duckdb
   `-- orders.sql
```

There is no `connection.options.yaml` file in this case, as the duckdb data source does not have any secret credentials.

### 5. Set up a source query
Add a new `.sql` file to the `sources/needful_things` directory. Name it `my_query.sql`, or a name of your choice.

In this file, write a query to select all columns from the `orders` table:

**my_query.sql**
```sql
select * from orders
```

Save the file. Later, you'll be able to refer to this data source as `needful_things.my_query`.

### 6. Run sources

Once you have configured source queries, you need to **run sources** to actually execute them.

If your dev server is running, sources will run automatically if you make changes to your queries.

If your data source itself has changed, or if you are building pages [for deployment](/deployment/overview/), you may need to run sources manually from the Command Line:

```bash
npm run sources
```

<Alert status=info>

**What does it mean to run sources?**
<br/>

Data from various sources and formats (i.e. Snowflake, a Postgres database, and a CSV) normally cannot be queried and joined using the same syntax or SQL dialect. Evidence transforms queries from all data sources to create one unified **data cache**, which can then be used within your pages.
<br/>


Learn more at at Core Concepts &gt; [Data Sources](/core-concepts/data-sources/).
</Alert>

### 7. Set up a Markdown Query
In order to make data from the data cache available for use on pages, you must create a **Markdown query** for it.

Clean up everything from your page, and add the following to create a Markdown query named `my_query_summary`:

**new-page.md**
````markdown
## Hello Evidence

### Orders Table

```my_query_summary
select * from needful_things.my_query
```
````
Refresh, and you'll see a grey box that looks like this:

![Add new source](/img/getting-started/my_query_summary_grey_box.png)

<Alert status=info>
If you don't see the box, click the 3-dot menu at the top right of the page and select Show Queries. You can hide or show queries on any Evidence-generated page, including this one.
</Alert>



We'll use this data in the next section!

<Alert status=info>

**What is the difference between a Source Query and a Markdown Query?**
<br>

A **source query** is run directly against your data source, and must be written in the dialect of SQL that matches it. Running sources populates the data cache, which is not directly accesible by components. Sources can be run manually.
<br>

A **Markdown query** is written in the DuckDB dialect, and is run against the data cache. Markdown queries run with every page load, and their outputs are directly accessible by components within your pages.
<br>

To learn more about Markdown queries, including how to reuse them across pages, take a look at Core Concepts &gt; [Markdown Queries](/core-concepts/queries/).

</Alert>

## Adding components

### 8. Create a Data Table

One simple way to display data is with a [Data Table](/components/data/data-table/). Add a `DataTable` component that uses `my_query_summary` as its data source:

**new-page.md**
````markdown
## Hello Evidence

### Orders Table

```my_query_summary
select * from needful_things.my_query
```

<DataTable data={my_query_summary} />
````

Refresh the page in your browser, and you should now see:

```my_query_summary
select * from needful_things.orders
```
<DataTable data={my_query_summary}/>



Very nice - you just made your first Evidence component. Let's refine things a bit.

The Markdown query isn't doing much at the moment. It's simply displaying all 10,000 records and all columns. We can make it more useful.

Let's say we want to pull the 100 most recent orders, in order to send these customers a discount code. Change the Markdown query to:

````markdown
```my_query_summary_top100
select
   order_datetime,
   first_name,
   last_name,
   email
from needful_things.my_query
order by order_datetime desc
limit 100
```
````

Now refresh, and notice that your table has changed to show only the most recent 100 orders, with only the table columns you specified:

```my_query_summary_top100
select
   order_datetime,
   first_name,
   last_name,
   email
from needful_things.orders
order by order_datetime desc
limit 100
```

<DataTable data={my_query_summary_top100} />




You can further select or rename the columns that appear in your table by specifying them in the `DataTable` component:

```markdown
<DataTable data={my_query_summary_top100}>
   <Column id=order_datetime title="Order Date"/>
   <Column id=first_name />
   <Column id=email />
</DataTable>
```
This will display:

<DataTable data={my_query_summary_top100}>
   <Column id=order_datetime title="Order Date"/>
   <Column id=first_name />
   <Column id=email />
</DataTable>



A Data Table is a built-in **component** of Evidence, and there are many more. To see a full list of components, take a look at the left-hand sidebar, or go to [All Components](/components/all-components/).

### 9. Create a Bar Chart

Next, let's visualize orders over the past year using a [Bar Chart](/components/charts/bar-chart). Add the following to your page. Notice that we are creating a new Markdown query called `orders_by_month`:

````markdown
### Orders by Month

```orders_by_month
select order_month, count(*) as orders from needful_things.my_query
group by order_month order by order_month desc
limit 12
```
<BarChart
    data={orders_by_month}
    x=order_month
    y=orders
	xFmt="mmm yyyy"
	xAxisTitle="Month"
	yAxisTitle="Orders"
/>
````
And you should see:

```orders_by_month
select order_month, count(*) as orders from needful_things.orders
group by order_month order by order_month desc
limit 12
```
<BarChart
    data={orders_by_month}
    x=order_month
    y=orders
	xFmt="mmm yyyy"
	xAxisTitle="Month"
	yAxisTitle="Orders"
/>

### 10. Connect a new CSV data source

Go to `localhost:3000/settings`, and select **Add new source**:

![Add new source](/img/getting-started/add_new_source.png)

Choose **CSV** as the source type, and upload a CSV file of your choice.

Here, we'll use [**us_alt_fuel_stations.csv**](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-422f2/resource/341957d8-daf6-4a38-ab1d-8ec1bc21cfb9) - a public data source on EV charging stations across the US.

Select Source Type: **CSV**, and give your source a name. Hit Confirm:

![Add new source](/img/getting-started/add_new_source2.png)

You can read about various configuration options for CSV files [here](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/data-sources/#csv-files). For now, leave this blank, and hit **Confirm Changes**:

![Add new source](/img/getting-started/add_new_source_confirm_changes.png)

You should now see your new source under the sources folder. Copy your CSV file into it:

```code
sources/
`-- ev_stations/
   |-- connection.yaml
   |-- connection.options.yaml
   `-- us_alt_fuel_stations.csv
```


That's it! You've set up a new data source. If you'd like to use it, try adding the following Markdown Query and the [USMap](/components/maps/us-map) component:

````markdown
### EV Map
```ev_map
select State, count(*) AS ev_station_count from ev_stations.us_alt_fuel_stations
where State not in ('CA')
group by State order by ev_station_count desc
```

<USMap data={ev_map} state=State abbreviations=true value=ev_station_count/>
````

And you should see:

```ev_map
select
   State,
   count(*) AS ev_station_count
from ev_stations.us_alt_fuel_stations
where State not in ('CA')
group by State order by ev_station_count desc
```

<USMap data={ev_map} state=State abbreviations=true value=ev_station_count/>

That's it! You now know the basics of setting up data sources, writing queries, and creating components in Evidence.
