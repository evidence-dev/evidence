GCP is Google's cloud platform. There are two GCP services that can be used to host Evidence apps: GCP Cloud Storage and Firebase Hosting.
- [GCP Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) is a service that allows you to store unstructured data in Google's cloud.
- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting) is a service that allows you to host static websites and single-page apps.

<Alert status="warning">

    A full walkthrough for GCP is not yet available, but documentation is available on the [Cloud Storage docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) and [Firebase Hosting docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

</Alert>

A GCP alternative hosting solution to Cloud Storage is [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting).
