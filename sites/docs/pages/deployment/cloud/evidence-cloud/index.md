Evidence Cloud is the easiest way to host Evidence apps. It's maintained by the Evidence team, and allows you to securely host Evidence apps without having to worry about maintaining your own infrastructure.

- **Easy to set up:** Deploy in 5 minutes without configuring any infrastructure.
- **Secure:** Manage access for users in your team.
- **Organizational domain:** Host your app at `[organisation].evidence.app`.
- **Scheduled refreshes:** Daily (or more frequent) data updates to your app.
- **Re-build on push:** Merge to your target branch to rebuild your app.
- **Custom domains:** Add a custom domain to your app.
- **Cloud execution engine:** Offload heavy queries to our Cloud SQL engine for faster performance.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- An Evidence project pushed to GitHub (optional)

## Deploy Evidence to Evidence Cloud

1. Go to <a href="https://evidence.app" target="_blank" class="markdown">Evidence Cloud</a> and login with GitHub
1. Choose an option to get started:
   1. **If you have an existing Evidence project:** click `Add Project`
   1. **If you don't have a Evidence project yet:** select `Start from our templates`, and choose evidence-dev/template.
1. Deploy your project
   - Repository: Choose the GitHub repository containing your Evidence project
   - Branch: Edit if required
   - Domain: Choose the subdomain you want to deploy to
   - (Optional) Root directory: Edit to point to your Evidence directory if you are using a monorepo
   - Authentication: None, Email and Password (Paid plans only), or SSO (Paid plans only)
1. Set your environment variables
   - **If you are deploying an existing project**, click "Paste Environment Variables"
        - Navigate to the <a href=http://localhost:3000/settings#deploy target="_blank" class="markdown">settings page</a> and use the **Copy All** button to copy them to your clipboard, then paste them into the Environment Variables section. Click **Save**.
        - Alternatively, you can find credentials in `connection.options.yaml` files in your `/sources/your_source` directory, and enter them in KEY=VALUE format on separate lines.
        - The key format used should be `EVIDENCE_SOURCE__[your_source]__[option_name]` (Note the casing matches your source names, and the double underscores). Note that the values are base64 encoded, and will need to be decoded.
   - **If you are deploying from a template**, click "Use Template Environment Variables"
1. Click `Deploy your project`

Your app will be deployed to https://[your-subdomain].evidence.app

### Account Management

<Details title="How do I add a new developer to my Evidence app?">

Give them access to your [Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-repository). All Evidence Cloud plans come with unlimited developer accounts.

</Details>

<Details title="Which git providers can I use with Evidence Cloud?">

We support GitHub by default. If your team needs another git provider, reach out on [Slack](https://slack.evidence.dev).

</Details>

### Troubleshooting

<Details title="I've successfully deployed the template app. How do I edit it?">

Clone the git repository to your local machine (the repo URL is shown in the cloud UI), make edits to the code and/or database settings, and merge the edits to your target branch.

</Details>


<Details title="How long do builds take?">

Most builds will be completed in under 2 minutes, and you can track progress in the build logs. The initial deployment may take longer as we provision your account.

</Details>


<Details title="When can I expect build failures?">

Evidence will not deploy sites with errors to prevent users from seeing broken reports. Usually, this is caused by an error with your code.  Enter `npm run build` in your editor to test if the build succeeds locally. If you are still having issues, reach out on [Slack](https://slack.evidence.dev).

</Details>

<Details title="How can I prevent queries or components with errors from making it to my site?">

As a default, a failed chart or query will not throw an error. To prevent failed charts or queries from building successfully, edit the build command in `package.json` to `"build": "evidence build:strict"`.
