[GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages) is a service that allows you to host static websites and single-page apps. Evidence apps can be deployed to GitLab Pages by pushing your Evidence project to a GitLab repository and enabling Pages for the repository.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account
- An Evidence project pushed to a GitLab repository

## Deploy Evidence to GitLab Pages

1. In <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" class="markdown">GitLab</a>, navigate to your Evidence project repository.
1. Add credentials as environment variables
    - Navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**
    - Click **Add Variable**, and use **Masked** visibility
    - Navigate to your Evidence project and go to the <a href=http://localhost:3000/settings#deploy target="_blank" class="markdown">settings page</a> and copy each of the environment variables keys and values
    - Alternatively, you can find credentials in `connection.options.yaml` files in your `/sources/your_source` directory. The key format used should be `EVIDENCE_SOURCE__[your_source]__[option_name]` (Note the casing matches your source names, and the double underscores). Note that the values are base64 encoded, and will need to be decoded.
1. Return to your GitLab project, and select **Deploy > Pages** in the left sidebar.
1. Get started with GitLab Pages
    - Build image: `node:22`
    - The application files are in the `public` folder: `true` (we'll change this in Evidence later)
    - Installation steps: `npm ci`
    - Build steps: 
        - `npm run sources`
        - `npm run build`
        - `cp -r build public`
    - Add a commit message, and click **Commit**

Your app will be available at `https://[your-repo]-[hexcode].gitlab.io/`. It will be only accessible to your account by default.
