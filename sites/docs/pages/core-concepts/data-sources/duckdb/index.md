DuckDB is an in-memory analytics database that supports persisting to a file on your local filesystem. Evidence supports connecting to DuckDB as a data source, allowing you to query data using SQL.

<NewSource sourceName="DuckDB" />

## Configuration

If using a persistent database, it should be stored in the directory `sources/[your_source_name]/`.

See the [DuckDB docs](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/index) for more information.

To connect to MotherDuck, see the [MotherDuck data source](/core-concepts/data-sources/motherduck) page.
