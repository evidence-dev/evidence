We think it's still too difficult to build high quality data products. Businesses are stuck with BI software that delivers slow and clunky outputs, and analysts are stuck manually configuring reports.

Our mission is to give you the tools to deliver production-quality data products that look and feel more like the New York Times' data journalism than a drag-and-drop dashboard.

Evidence combines the best of modern web frameworks with the best parts of BI:

- **Code-driven workflows:** Use your IDE, version control, and CI/CD tools
- **First-class text support:** Add context, explanation and insight to your reports
- **Programmatic features:** Use loops, conditionals, and templated pages to generate content from data
- **High performance:** Evidence apps are fast, reliable, and scalable
- **Lightweight setup:** Install locally and start building reports in just a few minutes

To get started, [install Evidence](/install-evidence).
