## Options

<Alert>

Append flags with an extra `--` after the command to modify behavior.

For example, `npm run dev -- --port 4000` will start the development server on port 4000.

Evidence's `dev` and `build` commands run using Vite, and so support [Vite's options](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html#options).

Evidence's `preview` command runs using `npx serve` and supports [Serve's options](https://github.com/vercel/serve/blob/main/source/utilities/cli.ts#L30)

## Environment Variables

You can set environment variables to configure Evidence in production. Most of these are used to set database credentials securely.

The format of environment variables for database credentials is `EVIDENCE_SOURCE__[source_name]__[variable_name]`.

You can copy all your current environment variable values from the settings page at [localhost:3000/settings](http://localhost:3000/settings).

N.B. Environment variables are **case sensitive**, so you should preserve the case specified in the settings page.

### .env Files

Evidence will read in environment variables from a `.env` file in the root of your project. This is useful for local development.

### Environment Variables in Source Queries

Environment variables to be used in source queries should be prefixed with `EVIDENCE_VAR__` (note the double underscore). They can be used in source queries with `${EVIDENCE_VAR__variable_name}`.

```bash
EVIDENCE_VAR__customer_name="Acme Corporation"
```

```bash
select *
from orders
where customer_name = '${customer_name}'
```

The quotes would be omitted if the variable was not a string.

### Environment Variables in Pages

Environment variables to be used in pages should be prefixed with `VITE_`. They can be accessed with `import.meta.env.VITE_variable_name`.

`.env`
```bash
VITE_customer_attribute=premium
```

`index.md`
```svelte
&lt;script&gt;
  const customer_attribute = import.meta.env.VITE_customer_attribute;
&lt;/script&gt;

{#if customer_attribute === 'premium'}

Premium content

{:else if customer_attribute === 'free'}

Free content

{/if}
```
